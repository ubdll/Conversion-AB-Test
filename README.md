# Conversion A/B Test by Using Statistical Test & Regression Model
Pacmann Final Project for Business Statistics
## 1. Introduction and Background
A company employs A/B testing, a randomized experimental approach to present various iterations of an element (such as a webpage, page component, or banner), simultaneously presented to distinct segments of the audience. This process aims to discern which version has the most substantial impact on driving key business metrics.
The majority of individuals are exposed to advertisements, constituting the experimental group, while a smaller subset, the control group, encounters a Public Service Announcement (PSA) or nothing at all, occupying the same space and size as the typical ad placement.
The primary objective of the dataset is to scrutinize these distinct groups, assessing the effectiveness of the advertisements, estimating the potential revenue generated by these ads, and determining whether the disparities between the groups hold statistical significance.
